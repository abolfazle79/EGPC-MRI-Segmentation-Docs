The proposed method integrates two key innovations: first, a comprehensive, multi-stage preprocessing pipeline is employed to generate a highly accurate brain mask by effectively removing skull-edge artifacts and noise. Second, the core GPC algorithm is augmented with intelligent, adaptive operators that dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. These operators adjust search parameters based on population diversity and convergence stagnation, enabling the algorithm to robustly escape local optima. This work demonstrates that the hybridization of the GPC algorithm with adaptive strategies and domain-specific preprocessing leads to a highly effective automated system for brain tumor segmentation, showing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of the results."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h4,{id:"keywords",children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Keywords"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.ol,{children:["\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Brain Tumor Segmentation"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Metaheuristic Algorithms"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC)"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Adaptive Operators"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Medical Image Processing"})}),"\n"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>a});var n=i(6540);const r={},o=n.createContext(r);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(o);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:s(e.components),n.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
