Raw MRI scans often contain noise, imaging artifacts, and non-brain tissues like the skull and fat. This page details the comprehensive, multi-stage pipeline we designed to clean the raw image and generate a highly accurate brain mask, ensuring our Enhanced GPC Algorithm operates only on relevant data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts-and-theory/smart-post-processing":{"id":"concepts-and-theory/smart-post-processing","title":"Smart Post-processing","description":"The output of the EGPC algorithm is a raw segmentation mask where pixels are assigned to different clusters. However, this raw mask may still contain noise, small artifacts, or non-tumor regions that were incorrectly clustered. The smartpostprocesstumor_segmentation function is a crucial final step that applies a series of intelligent and adaptive filters to refine this mask and produce a clinically plausible result.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"This project presents an Enhanced Giza Pyramids Construction (EGPC) framework, a novel metaheuristic approach for the automated segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/abstract-and-keywords":{"id":"introduction/abstract-and-keywords","title":"Abstract & Keywords","description":"This page provides the scientific abstract and the main keywords for our research paper, \\"An Enhanced GPC-based Metaheuristic with Adaptive Operators for Medical Image Segmentation.\\" It serves as a concise summary of the project\'s goals, methods, and contributions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/introduction-and-motivation":{"id":"introduction/introduction-and-motivation","title":"Introduction & Motivation","description":"This section provides a comprehensive introduction to the research problem.
