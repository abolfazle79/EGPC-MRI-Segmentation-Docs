The precise diagnosis, characterization, and monitoring of these tumors are paramount for effective treatment planning, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. Among various non-invasive medical imaging modalities, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the gold standard due to its superior soft-tissue contrast and its ability to provide detailed anatomical information. A fundamental step in analyzing MRI data is segmentation: the process of delineating tumor boundaries from surrounding healthy tissues. Accurate segmentation is essential for quantitatively assessing tumor volume, planning surgical interventions, and evaluating treatment response."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"However, manual segmentation by expert radiologists, while considered the gold standard, is exceedingly time-consuming, laborious, and suffers from significant intra- and inter-observer variability.
