# The Base GPC Algorithm

:::note Foundation of Our Work
This page describes the original Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC) algorithm as introduced by Harifi et al. [1]. Understanding this standard version is essential before exploring the significant enhancements we developed for our framework, which are detailed on the [Enhanced GPC Algorithm](./3-enhanced-gpc-algorithm.md) page.

## Inspiration and Core Idea

The Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC) algorithm is a novel population-based metaheuristic inspired by the collaborative effort of workers building the ancient Egyptian pyramids. The core concept models a group of "workers" who represent candidate solutions in a search space. Each worker's goal is to move a "stone block" (their current position or solution) towards the optimal installation point (the global optimum).

The key actors in this model are:

- **Workers:** The population of agents searching for the optimal solution. Each worker's position is a vector representing a potential solution.
- **Pharaoh's Special Agent:** This is an elitism mechanism. It represents the best worker (the best solution found so far across the entire population) and serves as a benchmark for others.

## Mathematical Model of Movement

The update mechanism in GPC is derived from the physics equations governing the movement of an object on an inclined plane. A worker's movement is determined by the combination of pushing a stone block up a ramp and their own repositioning efforts.

### Stone Displacement (`d`)

This component models the upward movement of the stone block on a ramp. It is calculated based on an initial velocity ($v_0$), gravity ($g$), the ramp angle ($\theta$), and a random friction coefficient ($\mu_k$).

The formula for displacement is:

$$
d = \frac{v_0^2}{2g(\sin\theta + \mu_k\cos\theta)}
$$

The inclusion of a random friction coefficient introduces a stochastic element that aids in exploration.

### Worker Movement (`x`)

This component models the worker's own small movements to find a better position to push the stone. It is calculated similarly but without friction, representing a more direct, effort-based repositioning.

The formula is:

$$
x = \frac{v_0^2}{2g\sin\theta}
$$

### Main Update Equation

A new candidate solution is generated by combining the previous position with the stone displacement (`d`) and scaling it by the worker's movement (`x`) and a random perturbation vector ($\epsilon$). The conceptual update rule is:

`p_new = (p_old + d) * (x * epsilon)`

## Substitution Mechanism

To balance the workforce and avoid stagnation, GPC employs a substitution mechanism similar to a crossover operation in genetic algorithms. With a certain probability (`pSS`), components of a worker's current position are replaced by components from the newly calculated position. This allows the algorithm to explore new combinations and prevents the entire population from converging to a single point too quickly.
