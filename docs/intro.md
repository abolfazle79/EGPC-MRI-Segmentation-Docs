# Welcome to the Enhanced GPC Project

This project presents an **Enhanced Giza Pyramids Construction (EGPC)** framework, a novel metaheuristic approach for the automated segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans.

The primary challenge in medical image analysis is achieving high accuracy while dealing with complex image artifacts and noise. Our work addresses this by integrating three key stages:

1.  **Advanced Preprocessing:** To clean the input image and accurately isolate the brain region.
2.  **Intelligent GPC Optimization:** To efficiently search for and identify the tumorous regions.
3.  **Smart Post-processing:** To refine the final segmentation mask and eliminate false positives.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the theory, implementation, and results of our framework. Use the sidebar to navigate through the different sections of the project.
