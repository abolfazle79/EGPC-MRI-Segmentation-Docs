# Visual Results: A Case Study

:::tip Demonstrating End-to-End Performance
This page provides a visual walkthrough of our framework's performance on a sample brain MRI scan from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of each stage of the pipeline, from initial preprocessing to the final tumor mask detection.

:::caution Important Note on Images
To display the images below, you must place your image files inside the `static/img` directory in your Docusaurus project root. Then, you can reference them using a path like `/img/your-image-name.png`. Please update the paths in this file to match your filenames.

## The Input: Raw MRI Scan

The process starts with a raw, unprocessed T2-weighted FLAIR MRI scan. As shown below, the original image contains the brain tissue as well as non-brain elements such as the skull, fat, and background noise. The tumor is visible as a hyperintense (bright) region.

## The Output: A Step-by-Step Visualization

Our framework (`final.py`) generates a comprehensive 4-panel plot that visualizes the entire segmentation process and its final result. This allows for a clear, qualitative assessment of the method's performance.

## Analysis of Each Panel

Each panel in the final output image highlights a specific stage of our pipeline.

### Panel 1: Original MRI Scan

This panel shows the raw input image for baseline comparison, identical to Fig. 1.

### Panel 2: Preprocessed & Masked MRI

This panel displays the result of our [advanced preprocessing pipeline](../3-concepts-and-theory/2-image-preprocessing-pipeline.md). Key observations here are:

- **Skull Stripping:** All non-brain tissues (skull, background) have been successfully removed.
- **Artifact Removal:** Bright artifacts at the skull-brain boundary have been eliminated.
- **Contrast Enhancement:** The local contrast within the brain tissue has been enhanced, making the boundaries between different tissue types more distinct and preparing the image for accurate clustering.

### Panel 3: Tumor Contour on Original

This view overlays the final detected tumor boundary as a red contour line on the original, unprocessed MRI. This is a clinically relevant visualization, as it allows for a direct comparison between the algorithm's output and the original anatomical context, which is useful for validation by experts.

### Panel 4: Detected Tumor Overlay

This panel provides the most intuitive result. The final, cleaned tumor mask is overlaid with a semi-transparent red color on the original image. This visualization makes the exact size, shape, and location of the detected tumor immediately obvious and easy to interpret.

The visual results clearly demonstrate the framework's capability to handle raw medical data, perform robust artifact removal, and accurately localize the tumor region.
