#### **Abstract**

Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. However, this task presents significant challenges due to the complex nature of tumor structures, ambiguous boundaries, and intensity similarities with healthy tissues. While metaheuristic algorithms provide a powerful framework for navigating complex optimization problems like segmentation, standard implementations often suffer from premature convergence to local optima, limiting their accuracy.

To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel and robust framework based on an enhanced Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC) metaheuristic. The proposed method integrates two key innovations: first, a comprehensive, multi-stage preprocessing pipeline is employed to generate a highly accurate brain mask by effectively removing skull-edge artifacts and noise. Second, the core GPC algorithm is augmented with intelligent, adaptive operators that dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. These operators adjust search parameters based on population diversity and convergence stagnation, enabling the algorithm to robustly escape local optima. This work demonstrates that the hybridization of the GPC algorithm with adaptive strategies and domain-specific preprocessing leads to a highly effective automated system for brain tumor segmentation, showing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of the results.
